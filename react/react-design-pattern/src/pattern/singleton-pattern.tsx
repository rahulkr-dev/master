      The Singleton pattern is a design pattern that ensures a class has only
      one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. In
      simpler terms, it ensures that there is only one "copy" of a particular
      object throughout the entire application. Imagine you have a class
      representing a resource or service that should be shared across different
      parts of your application. You want to make sure that no matter how many
      times you try to create an instance of that class, you always get the same
      instance back. Here's a simple analogy: Think of a factory that produces
      cars. The Singleton pattern ensures that there's only one factory
      producing cars in your entire town. No matter how many times someone asks
      for a car factory, they always get the same one. We use the Singleton
      pattern for various reasons: Resource Management: It helps in managing
      resources efficiently. For example, a configuration manager in a web
      application, where you want to ensure all parts of the application access
      the same configuration settings. Global State: When we need to maintain a
      single source of truth for certain pieces of data across the application.
      For instance, a user authentication service that holds the logged-in
      user's information. Avoiding Duplicate Resources: It prevents the creation
      of duplicate instances of a resource, which can lead to inconsistencies or
      wastage of resources. Encapsulation: It encapsulates the instantiation
      logic within the class, making it easy to change later without affecting
      the rest of the code. Overall, the Singleton pattern helps in ensuring
      consistency, resource efficiency, and easy access to shared resources or
      services across an application. However, it should be used judiciously, as
      overusing it can lead to tight coupling and difficulties in testing.
